# MIPS-Assembly-Project

## About The Project 

The assembly program was intended on getting familar with low level programming languages such as assembly and understanding how low level programming is used to communicate directly with computer hardware.The program is designed to read three input values of type int and assign them to the global variables: length, width, and height. If any of the values entered are 0 or less than 0, the program will display -1. However, if all the input values are valid, the program will proceed to calculate the surface area of a rectangular prism using the provided length, width, and height. Finally, it will print the calculated surface area followed by a newline character.
